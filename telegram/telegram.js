// This function takes in a string (a sentence) that contains several words
// and an integer n. 
// It outputs an array of strings, where each string contains as many words
// as possible but is never longer than n characters.
// The strings in the output array, when combined, should contain the original sentence.
// Words may not be split, but you may assume that no single word is too long.


// Example1: telegram("Bring your dog to the office", 6) =>
// ["Bring", "your", "dog to", "the", "office"]

// Example2: telegram("The rain in Spain stays mainly in the plain", 8) = >
// ["The rain", "in Spain", "stays", "mainly", "in the", "plain"]


// For simplicity let's assume that the input string contains only one sentence
// without any special characters (periods, commas etc).



var telegram = function(string, n){
  // Your code here
}
